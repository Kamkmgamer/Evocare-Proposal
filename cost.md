Alright. This is the **right move** for the Egyptian market.
When clients reject a big number, it is usually because it feels abstract.
Breaking it down by **features and pages** makes it feel controllable and negotiable.

Below is a **clean, feature based proposal** you can send as is.
No tech stack wars. No frameworks. Just value and costs.

I will use **new realistic numbers**, tuned for Egypt, urgent delivery, but not luxury agency pricing.
