## Clear Roadmap

Extended for separation (13–18 weeks total). Leadership delegates to juniors.

1. **Phase 1: UI/UX Research & Initial Design (1–2 weeks)**: Analysis. Junior 1 leads.
2. **Phase 2: UI/UX Final Design (1–2 weeks)**: Finalize. Junior 1 executes.
3. **Phase 3: Frontend Development (3–4 weeks)**: React build. Junior 2 develops.
4. **Phase 4-5: Backend Development (Core + Business Logic) (3–4 weeks)**: Laravel APIs. Lead directs.
5. **Phase 6: Integration & Optimization (2–3 weeks)**: Connect stacks. Team effort.
6. **Phase 7: QA, Testing & Launch (2–3 weeks)**: Testing. Junior 3 leads.

Total: 12–18 weeks (MVP by week 10). Risks: Integration delays.

## Project Shares

Team structure: Lead (Khalil Abdalmageed) 40%, Junior 1 (Design) 20%, Junior 2 (Front-End) 25%, Junior 3 (QA/Integration) 15%. For EGP 450,000 mid-estimate:

- Lead (Khalil Abdalmageed): 40% = EGP 180,000.
- Junior 1 (Design): 20% = EGP 90,000.
- Junior 2 (Front-End): 25% = EGP 112,500.
- Junior 3 (QA/Integration): 15% = EGP 67,500.
