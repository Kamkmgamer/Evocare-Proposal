# Document 1: Detailed Price Estimation, Roadmap, and Project Shares for Full-Stack Next.js Approach

**Prepared by:** Khalil Abdalmageed, Back-End Developer & Team Lead  
**Date:** December 25, 2025  
**Purpose:** This document provides a comprehensive breakdown for Approach 1 (Full-Stack Next.js with tRPC + PostgreSQL), tailored for the Evocare project. The estimate reflects efficient team collaboration with Khalil Abdalmageed as senior lead overseeing 3 juniors, incorporating local Egyptian market standards for domestic clients. It includes the phased roadmap and project shares based on the team structure (lead handling oversight and back-end, juniors assigned to design, front-end, and QA/integration).

## Detailed Price Estimation

Total Estimated Cost: **EGP 335,000 – 435,000** (based on local 2025 benchmarks for similar custom projects). Breakdown assumes 780–1,070 total hours, with efficiencies from junior delegation. Costs include urgency buffer (10%) and tools (e.g., Vercel ~EGP 5,000/year).

## Clear Roadmap

Aligned with the 7-phase plan, compressed for urgency (total 9–13 weeks). Leadership ensures juniors handle routine tasks, with weekly reviews.

1. **Phase 1: UI/UX Research & Initial Design (1–2 weeks)**: Competitor analysis, wireframing. Junior 1 leads; lead approves. Deliver: Figma prototypes.
2. **Phase 2: UI/UX Final Design (1–2 weeks)**: Refine designs. Junior 1 executes; client approval.
3. **Phase 3: Frontend Development (2–3 weeks)**: Build Next.js structure. Junior 2 develops; lead integrates tRPC stubs.
4. **Phase 4-5: Backend Development (Core + Business Logic) (2–3 weeks)**: DB/APIs. Lead directs; juniors assist on testing. Milestones: API demo.
5. **Phase 6: Integration & Optimization (1–2 weeks)**: Add integrations. Team collaboration; lead oversees.
6. **Phase 7: QA, Testing & Launch (1–2 weeks)**: Full QA. Junior 3 leads; deployment and training.

Total: 8–14 weeks (MVP by week 8). Risks: Junior ramp-up adds 1 week if needed.

## Project Shares

Team structure: Lead (Khalil Abdalmageed) 40% (oversight, back-end, management); Junior 1 (Design) 20%; Junior 2 (Front-End/Dev) 25%; Junior 3 (QA/Integration) 15%. Based on effort; total 100%. For EGP 385,000 mid-estimate:

- Lead (Khalil Abdalmageed): 40% = EGP 154,000.
- Junior 1 (Design): 20% = EGP 77,000.
- Junior 2 (Front-End/Dev): 25% = EGP 96,250.
- Junior 3 (QA/Integration): 15% = EGP 57,750.
